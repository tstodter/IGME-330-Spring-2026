## V. Attendance

Attendance is mandatory and you are expected to be on time. Lectures will start promptly at the beginning of class, and may be followed by an in-class assignment or exercise that you are expected to work on until the end of the meeting (i.e. no leaving early, or doing HW for a different course).

Your final course grade will be determined based on the following course element weights & letter grade thresholds:

### Course Element Weights

| Course Element | Weight |
| :------------- | :----- |
| Exams | 30% |
| Homework ("mini-project") Assignments | 30% |
| Exercises & Quizzes | 30% |
| Attendance/Participation | 10% |

### Letter Grade Thresholds

| :---------- | :----------- |
| >= 90 | A |

## VII. Course Elements

### EXAMS (30%)

There will be two traditional **closed-notes/digital** "exams" (Referred to as the "Midterm Quiz and Final Quiz") covering concepts covered throughout the course, as well as a couple of simple "write some code" questions. There will be three **open-notes/hands-on practical** "exams" (Referred to as "Practical 1, 2, and 3") that will ask students to use what they've recently learned and practiced to complete a simple web app according to provided instructions. The top 4 scores from these 5 exams (dropping the lowest) will be averaged together with equal weight to determine your overall Exam score.

### EXERCISES & QUIZZES (30%)

**Exercises:**
- There will be approximately 20 exercises assigned during the semester that help you learn and practice concepts and get ready for the major "homeworks/mini-projects". Some may be worth more or less than others. These exercises may be: 
  - Designed to help you build something similar to what you'll need to do in the future
  - Started in class, to be completed outside of class.
  - Activities or assignments that you'll be asked to complete and submit (or answer a couple questions about) to round out your web development knowledge or pick up an extra skill that you might want to use on a homework.

**Quizzes:**
- There will be a variety of low-pressure quiz experiences. There will some combination of:
  - Study Quizzes: Based on readings & taken online with multiple attempts allowed
  - Practice Quizzes: Taken in class with a limited timeframe, but more for attendance/participation/informational purposes. 

### HOMEWORK ("MINI-PROJECT") ASSIGNMENTS (30%)

Sometime referred to as "mini-projects", these are substantial assignments that you will given a week or so to complete, approximately 5 of these will be assigned during the semester. When possible we'll try to provide ways for you to alter the project in a way that makes it better as a portfolio piece.

### ATTENDANCE/PARTICIPATION (10%)

This grade category covers in-class activities or attendance tracking. If you miss class, you'll miss those points. We won't generally track attendance, but we might...and grades in this category can't be made up without prior notice of absence.

You can request to be excused from a class meeting for a school or career related opportunity - message or email your instructor *in advance* of that class meeting.

If you can't attend class for any reason, always let us know *in advance*. Simply telling us *afterward* will not automatically excuse your absence.

## VIII. More Grading Policies

### VIII-A. Late Assignments

- All assigned work (exercises, homeworks, quizzes, etc) is due at the announced date and time (usually the due date posted with the assignment drop box on MyCourses). Unless stated otherwise, there is no grade deduction for submitting work late. However, late submissions will not be accepted once we have graded the assignment in question. **We may grade an assignment at any point after the due date.** If you foresee a scheduling conflict with a posted assignment, contact me as soon as possible to work out an alternative submission plan.

### VIII-B. Policy on Incomplete Grades

- Incomplete grades will be given only in the most exceptional circumstances, soley for issues that arise AFTER the 'W' deadline has passed, and then only by prior arrangement with the professor. Being overcommitted and/or not having enough time to complete your coursework is not sufficient justification for an "I". Instead, meet with the professor as early as possible in the semester if you're having difficulty.

### VIII-C. Academic Integrity

As part of the RIT academic community, it is imperative that you maintain the highest standards of academic honesty in this course. This policy outlines our commitment to uphold academic integrity and the consequences of violating it.

- Cheating: Engaging in any form of fraudulent or deceptive academic act, including falsification of data and unauthorized possession or use of materials, sources, or tools. See also our Generative AI policy (next section).
- Collusion: Inappropriate collaboration with others in work that is meant to be completed individually.
- Plagiarism: Representing the ideas of others as your own without proper attribution.
- Duplicate Submission: Submitting work in this course that you have previously submitted in this course or another, without prior approval. Importantly, if you have previously taken this course and are retaking it (whether due to a withdrawal or to improve a grade), all submitted work must be original and created anew for this semester. Resubmitting past work, even your own, without explicit permission is not allowed and will be treated as a breach of academic integrity.

Consequences: Breaches of academic integrity, including but not limited to cheating, collusion, plagiarism, and duplicate submission, will result in serious disciplinary action. This may range from failing the assignment to potentially failing the course, depending on the violation's severity. Each case will be carefully reviewed in accordance with the RIT Academic Integrity Policy.

For full details on the policy and your responsibilities within it, please visit [RIT's Academic Integrity website](https://www.rit.edu/academicintegrity/).

### VIII-D. Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT)

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Github Copilot, Claude Code, and others can be both a help and a hindrance. They can act as a force multiplier, boosting your efficiency, effectiveness, and creativity. However, relying on them too much may impact your learning of essential concepts. Additionally, some employers may not permit their intellectual property to be fed into these systems, and so disallow their usage.

In this class:
- You should use generative AI if I explicitly ask you to do so; you should not use generative AI if I explicitly forbid you from doing so.
- You should use generative AI if it enhances your work, but does not replace your understanding.
- Always document all tools and sources that significantly impacted your work (this would include generative AI).
- Use generative AI to quickly become effective with new tools and technology, but remain vigilant that you do not become dependent on them. Tools exist to expand your agency, and should be abandoned when they become limitations. 
- **Never** submit work taken directly from a machine or any other source.

You are responsible for understanding the course content on your own, and demonstrating this understanding, without machine assistance.

## XII. Student Support & Wellbeing

Success in this course depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Recognize that stress is an expected part of the college experience, and it often can be compounded by unexpected setbacks or life changes outside the classroom. Moreover, those with marginalized identities may be faced with additional social stressors. I strongly encourage you to reframe challenges as an unavoidable pathway to success. Reflect on your role in taking care of yourself throughout the term, before the demands of exams and projects reach their peak. Please feel free to reach out to me about any difficulty you may be having that may impact your performance in this course as soon as it occurs and before it becomes unmanageable. In addition to your academic advisor, I strongly encourage you to contact the many other support services on campus that stand ready to assist you.

If you feel you are in need of counseling services, you can call [Counseling & Psychological Services (CaPS)](https://www.rit.edu/studentaffairs/counseling/get-support/need-help-now) at [475-2261](tel:475-2261) during business hours (M-Th, 8:30 to 4:30) or go directly to CaPS on the second floor of the August Center (AUG). Additional contact information is available at the link.
